+ Choice of learning rate

> **Reminder:** In order for Gradient Descent to work you must choose the learning rate wisely. The learning rate $\alpha$ determines how rapidly we update the parameters. If the learning rate is too large we may "overshoot" the optimal value. Similarly, if it is too small we will need too many iterations to converge to the best values. That's why it is crucial to use a well-tuned learning rate.

> Different learning rates give different costs and thus different predictions results.
If the learning rate is too large, the cost may oscillate up and down. It may even diverge.
A lower cost doesn't mean a better model. You have to check if there is possibly overfitting. It happens when the training accuracy is a lot higher than the test accuracy.
In deep learning, we usually recommend that you:
Choose the learning rate that better minimizes the cost function.
If your model overfits, use other techniques to reduce overfitting.
